etting up Jenkins with Github, Sonarqube, and Docker integration:

Step 1: Create AWS EC2 Instances

    Create three AWS EC2 instances using Ubuntu as the operating system - one for Jenkins, one for Sonarqube, and one for Docker.

Step 2: Install Jenkins

    Connect to the Jenkins server using SSH and install Jenkins on the AWS EC2 instance following the appropriate installation instructions for Ubuntu.
    Access the Jenkins web interface and configure Jenkins with the necessary plugins for integrating with Github and Sonarqube.

Step 3: Set up Github Repository

    Create a Github repository for your project if you haven't already.
    Add your project code to the Github repository and configure the repository to trigger Jenkins builds on push or pull request events.

Step 4: Integrate Github with Jenkins

    Install the Github plugin in Jenkins to integrate Jenkins with your Github repository.
    Configure the Github plugin in Jenkins to connect to your Github repository and enable build triggers.

Step 5: Configure Sonarqube

    Install and configure Sonarqube on the Sonarqube server, following the appropriate installation instructions for Sonarqube.
    Install the Sonarqube plugin in Jenkins to enable code quality analysis during the build process.
    Configure the Sonarqube plugin in Jenkins to connect to your Sonarqube server and run code quality analysis on your project code.

Step 6: Add SSH Key for Docker Server

    Generate an SSH key pair on the Jenkins server.
    Add the public key to the authorized_keys file on the Docker server, allowing Jenkins to connect to the Docker server using SSH.

Step 7: Transfer Code to Docker Server

    Install the SSH plugin in Jenkins to enable SSH-based file transfer.
    Configure the SSH plugin in Jenkins with the SSH private key and credentials for the Docker server.
    Use Jenkins to transfer the code from the Github repository to the Docker server using SSH.

Step 8: Create Docker Image and Deploy

    Use Docker commands in Jenkins to build a Docker image of your application using the transferred code.
    Push the Docker image to a Docker registry or deploy it directly to the Docker server.
    Optionally, configure the Docker plugin in Jenkins to automate the Docker image creation and deployment process.
